# TypeScript Type Annotations (and values and variables?) // Type Definitions

## Learning Goals

- Working with type inference
  - let and const declarations
  - literal Types
  - implicit any
- adding type annotations
- function arguments + returns (maybe diff lesson)

## Introduction

- different ways to utilize ts to our benefit
- adding types to things helps us see errors quickly

## Type Inference

- show image of js showing a type
  - show its implicit in ts
- difference with let and const
- variables are "born" with their types
- implicit "any"

## Type Assignment

-

## Type Annotations

- how to define our own types
- what that looks like

## Adding Types to Functions

- defining function arguments
- return types
- void values?
